# Just a placeholder
# To remind me that empires need to have a centralized value
# a strongly centralized empire (angers vassals) hinders growth of other
# cities besides the capital. Also, more people will
# travel to the capital. Assimilation of the main culture is strong.
# a less centralized empire (happy vassals) leaves most ressources to
# their cities, except if a city hungers, then food is distributed to 
# that city.
# Monarchies and Theocracies (especially with a military focus) 
# will usually strive for more centralization, while Republics and
# Trade Alliances will usually not strive for centralization.
# The capital city of every empire always gets a growth bonus, 
# which is substracted off the population of other cities in the empire.
# Generally population wanders to bigger cities (esp with the same culture)

# Titles in an empire will be created dynamically.
# If the leader of the empire conquers a realm with a title of equal
# rank, he will assign himself a higher one.
