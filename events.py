"""
This file contains various events, which are trigerred after a certain
number of ticks. Cities use a seed system for that, which means they
have a number between 0 and 9 assigned, and only trigger when the tick
shows their number.
To optimize performance, it might be better to save all cities in a 
dictionary, ordered by their seed, so the algorithm doesn't need 
to parse the whole list of cities every time.
